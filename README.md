## About

This project is a web application that allows users to send and receive temporary emails, without needing to register or password. The goal is to offer a simple and safe way to avoid spam, phishing and other types of online abuse. The project uses @apollo/client to communicate with an external GraphQL API that provides email data, and context API to manage the application state. The project also uses @mui/material to create elegant and responsive visual components, phosphor-react to add emoticons, styled-components to style components with CSS-in-JS, moment to format email dates, and react -copy-to-clipboard for easy copying of the email address generated by the application.
